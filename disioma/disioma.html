1. <big id="wr"><b>Writing/Reading</big></b><br>
this is strange(?) but its at least more consistent than english which is good enough<br><br>

1.1. <b id="wr_ds">Disaci script</b><br>
<img src="disaci.png" style="float: right">
disaci (dis(a), this and ci, symbol) is a silly script copying latin because its . <ruby>kind of a mess<rt>q p b d</rt></ruby><br>
its mostly just normal latin except:<br>
<ul>
	<li>voiced consonants get a "," instead of being completely different (similar with f/v and x/c)</li>
	<li>minor vowel changes for convenience</li>
	<li>and l becomes upside down r</li>
</ul><br>

1.2. <b id="wr_s">Sounds</b><br>
so theres those funny letters at the bottom that go /something/<br>
thats ipa but if you dont care about it, the relevant ones go like this:<br>
<ul>
	<li>/a/ is like f<b>a</b>ther</li>
	<li>/e/ is like b<b>e</b>rry</li>
	<li>/i/ is like s<b>ee</b></li>
	<li>/j/ is <b>y</b>es</li>
	<li>/o/ is like m<b>o</b>re</li>
	<li>/u/ is like f<b>oo</b>d</li>
	<li>/ɾ/ is usa english a<b>t</b>om (or spanish ca<b>r</b>o)</li>
	<li>/ʃ/ is like emo<b>ti</b>on</li>
	<li>/tʃ/ is like <b>ch</b>ina</li>
</ul>
<small>why are half the issues vowels english i hate you</small><br><br>

1.3. <b id="wr_ss">Syllable silliness</b><br>
you know how a lot of <ruby>natural languages have tons of consonants together<rt>e n g l i s h</rt></ruby><br>
well thats cringe so here the worst you can get is (C(Y))V(N) with C being consonants, Y being semivowels (y and w), V being vowels and N being n and m<br>
is this mostly stolen from japanese ? yes ! is that an issue ? no !<br>
<br><br>

2. <big id="bs"><b>Basic Stuff</big></b><br>
you know i wonder why do i capitalize titles if i dont capitalize anything else<br>
this has <i>how the language works</i>, by basics i mean everything because theres nothing else ive decided yet<br><br>

2.1. <b id="bs_wo">Word origins</b><br>
this language steals words from other langauges<br>
intending to have the fewest changes possible (so that sand could be arena stolen from spanish arena, no changes) without it also stealing only from few languages<br>
this could make things messy and confusing fortunately i have a solution: compounds<br>
instead of having 328947923784 random words i combine a bunch and make it easier to remember(?)<br>
as for these, if the original word ends with a consonant (so "this" becomes "disa") the extra vowel can be removed if theres another vowel: disioma comes from "disa" meaning "this", and "ioma" meaning "language" (which comes from spanish idioma)<br>
despite all of this, there <i>are</i> a bunch of original and "original" words<br><br>

2.2. <b id="bs_naa">Nouns and adjectives</b><br>
Those Which Identify and Those Which Describe<br>
its just like . the same as english:
"<ruby>rabe<rt>red</rt></ruby> <ruby>kauca<rt>couch</rt></ruby>"<br><br><br>

thats it for now im lazy
